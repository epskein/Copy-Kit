I want you to create an ultra simple app called “PROMPTER” , a prompt Building tool that enables a user that writes a lot of prompts to an AI to eliminate the tedious process of writing repetitive prompts.
The app should allow a user to upload a markdown/text file with history of a conversation with an AI model on a specific topic, which is then to be analysed and used to help create a repository of suggestions for the user to choose from (kind of like a prompt-‘auto-complete’. Common phrases/strings  and the order in which they were sent should represent the order in which suggestions are made.
Topics can be accessed by selecting them, after which the corresponding suggestions should be thrown.
Topics can be Grouped and groups should be named.

Keep UI Minimal and dont add any unncessary fields.


------------------------


Use the attached guide to improve the functionality of the app.
The patterns should appear as single click copy to clipboard buttons/banners.

-------------------------


Add a third tab for the user to see their full isolated prompts in order as well.
